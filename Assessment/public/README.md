• Why you designed it like this (navigation, layout,
colour choices)

I think the colours are nice, not too offensive. The navbar is at the top of each page, I think that's just where it should go. The layout was mostly decided by the clients specifications 

• What challenges you faced

Sometimes editing a file wouldn't change the design/ layout of the website, so I had to change the name of the css file occasionally, luckily I've delt with the problem before so it didn't take too long to fix
