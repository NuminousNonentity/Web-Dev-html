1031 website assessment 

• Why you designed it like this (navigation, layout,
colour choices)

I think the colours are nice, not too offensive. The navbar is at the top of each page, I think that's just where it should go. The layout was mostly decided by the clients specifications 

• What challenges you faced

Sometimes editing a file wouldn't change the design/ layout of the website, so I had to change the name of the css file occasionally, luckily I've dealt with the problem before so it didn't take too long to fix. Some of the css was difficult to get right and bootstrap was being a pain at times
